# Machine Learning with R

This project demonstrates how to use the R programming language to perform various machine learning tasks, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Each algorithm is implemented using popular R packages and applied to sample datasets, showcasing model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Overview

Machine learning in R is facilitated by a wide range of built-in and external packages, making it a powerful tool for statistical modeling and data analysis. In this project, we apply several common supervised learning algorithms:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**

## Technologies Used

- **R** (version 4.x recommended)
- Packages: `e1071`, `caret`, `rpart`, `randomForest`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Used for classification tasks.
- Implemented with the `e1071` package.

### 2. Logistic Regression
- Used for binary classification.
- Implemented with base R functions and `caret` for workflow.

### 3. Decision Trees
- Used for classification and regression.
- Implemented with the `rpart` package.

### 4. Random Forest
- Ensemble method for classification and regression.
- Implemented with the `randomForest` package.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Install required packages:

```r
install.packages(c("e1071", "caret", "rpart", "randomForest", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
```

### Running the Code

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the R scripts corresponding to each algorithm (e.g., `svm_example.R`, `logistic_regression_example.R`, etc.).
3. Run the scripts in your R environment.

## Usage

- Each script loads a sample dataset (e.g., `iris`, `mtcars`, or imported CSV).
- Data preprocessing steps such as normalization, splitting into training and test sets, and feature selection are included.
- Models are trained and evaluated with accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

#### Example: Training an SVM

```r
library(e1071)
data(iris)
set.seed(123)
train_index <- sample(1:nrow(iris), 0.7 * nrow(iris))
train <- iris[train_index, ]
test <- iris[-train_index, ]
svm_model <- svm(Species ~ ., data = train)
predictions <- predict(svm_model, test)
table(predictions, test$Species)
```

## Results

Results for each algorithm include:

- Model accuracy
- Confusion matrix
- ROC/AUC (where applicable)
- Visualization of classification boundaries (for SVM and Decision Trees)
